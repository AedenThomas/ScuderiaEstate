## Who is our customer?

| **Customer**             | **Value Proposition**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Real Estate Agents       | To access real-time pricing trends and property insights, enabling better listings and faster deals. |
| Property Developers      | To compare property values across locations and forecast growth for strategic development planning. |
| Home Buyers & Sellers    | To make more informed decisions using AI-driven property valuations and market intelligence.     |

### Properties Price Trends in London and Opportunities 
Figure 2 demonstrates the annual changes in prime London property from 2013 to 2023. It showcased the market fluctuations, which demonstrated the volatile nature of the London housing market.  Understanding these trends is essential for making informed decisions for real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers or sellers. Real estate agents can time listings and set competitive prices, developers can assess growth areas and market timing, and buyers or sellers can evaluate the best moments to transact. Therefore, ScuderiaEstate addresses the key pain points across these sectors by delivering AI-powered insights and predictive analytics, empowering users to make faster, data-driven decisions based on real-time pricing trends and market dynamics.

## What is our unique selling proposition (USP)? 
Many platforms offer real estate-related data, but they typically cater to specific user groups‚Äîsuch as investors, developers, or landlords‚Äîand often suffer from complex interfaces, high subscription fees, or outdated designs.
These factors create barriers for users seeking both usability and meaningful insights to support better property decisions.
Figure 8 shows how existing platforms and our service are positioned in relation to their target users and typical limitations.

Figure 8. Competitor Positioning Overview
<img width="780" alt="Competitor Analysis1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97a5526e-2622-4009-b10c-b715c79d23e5" />

Our service integrates AI-powered price predictions, crime and environmental risk data, and demographic insights‚Äîkey elements often overlooked by competitors.
Unlike platforms that demand specialized knowledge or expensive subscriptions, ScuderiaEstate is built for accessibility, with an intuitive interface and affordable pricing that works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile.
In a market often seen as either fragmented or overly complex, ScuderiaEstate offers a new-generation real estate information platform that combines clarity, reliability, and intelligent technology. This is clearly demonstrated in Table 1.

<img width="780" alt="timeline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3da05877-d582-485e-a3c3-5dc6eb33cf4c" />


### Achievements to Date
Since announcing our business plan, we have made steady progress on multiple fronts. We have validated our concept through interviews with potential users and industry players and refined our direction accordingly. To ensure smooth collaboration, we clearly defined our team structure and roles, and development was achieved through a centralized GitHub repository. We also prepared the legal foundation for the formation of a limited company, including compliance with GDPR and AML regulations. We developed AI-powered functional prototypes and improved usability based on early feedback. Additionally, we began testing marketing strategies leveraging Instagram to explore possibilities for user engagement and outreach.

### Next Steps
**Minimum Investment** :
We plan to secure the minimum amount of funding required to establish the company and continue MVP development. We will also consider participating in university-related incubators and pitch events.

**Agree on Board Structure and Shareholding** : 
To ensure transparency and sustainability, we will formalize the roles and responsibilities of board members and clarify the shareholding structure in preparation for launch.

### Sales & Marketing Execution Plan
Go-to-market strategies will play a crucial role going forward. The following plan outlines how we will work towards user acquisition, conversion, and retention in 2025 April and beyond.

### Future Vision

We aim to transition to a limited company (PLC) and IPO on the London Stock Exchange when ScuderiaEstate is valued at ¬£50 million. After this milestone is achieved, we will set up regional subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia to expand globally. We plan to maintain a unified global brand while adapting to local markets.


## Risks and Challenges
The three most significant risks we have identified are labour shortages, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory changes. Any of these risks could have a serious impact on business continuity if not addressed. We have developed mitigation and contingency plans to mitigate potential damage and ensure the stability of our services, as shown in Table 3.

Table 3. Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Category         | Labour Shortages                                                                 | Regulatory Changes                                                                 | Cybersecurity Risks                                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Summary          | We may struggle to hire legal, AI, or security experts due to talent competition. | Policy shifts or legal action could reduce access to foreign investors or AI tools. | Mishandling sensitive data could lead to fraud, legal penalties, or loss of trust.       |
| Mitigation Plan  | We will offer remote work, stock options, and training to attract and develop talent. | We will hire legal advisors and ensure our AI is explainable and regularly audited. | We will implement strong KYC, monitor transactions with AI, and follow GDPR/AML rules.   |
| Contingency Plan | We will reassign staff, hire freelancers, or narrow service focus if needed.     | We will adapt our AI or pivot to safer markets like the UK and EU.                 | We will freeze accounts, notify regulators, and use cyber insurance to limit the impact. |
